README: 

The goals of this assignment is to create an android application that will draw a (randomly sized) rectangle or a circle to the screen. It will also have the shapes fade as more objects are outputted to the screen, which eventually would make them disappear completely. The application also has a button that will clear the entire display of all the objects on it and reset the shape counter to zero for both the rectangles and the circles. This write up is to explain the process that I endeavored in completing this assignment, as well as the resources that I used in order to achieve the goals that were required. The goal was to learn how to create java classes that would subclass each other. This also allows us to implement a factory design pattern in a hands on matter. The software design pattern allows a small amount of abstraction applied to our class, which allows each of the child classes to implement their own version of the method. In this class, the Rectangle and the Circle have their own version of onDraw(). The onDraw() method is the method that will handle most of the drawing to the screen deciding size and color of the object that needs to be drawn.  This assignment allows us to add some abstraction to our classes and using a factory design pattern in Android Studio. The design pattern adds more readability to our classes and creates layers that keep us from having to edit code in each class to do a single thing (in this case transparency).
